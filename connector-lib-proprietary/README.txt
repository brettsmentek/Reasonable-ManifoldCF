This directory is meant to contain proprietary jars required for the execution
of connectors, which cannot be redistributed under the Apache license.

If you receive the binary distribution of ManifoldCF, and you want to enable
one of the proprietary connectors, you must place the required proprietary
material in this directory, and then enable the connector by uncommenting
the appropriate entries in the connectors.xml file.  Further information can be
found on the "how-to-build-and-deploy.html" documentation page.
